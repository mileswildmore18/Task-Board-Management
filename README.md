# Task-Board-Management

![alt text](<website screenshot.png>)

Welcome to the task management website, where you get a chance to add tasks to the to do list when you visit the page.

You can add a new task to the list by going to "Add Task" and opening a modal form and create a task title, the day that the task is due, and give a description of what the task is about to submit to the page. When the information is added onto the task card, you can also see it in the local storage array saving all the information you have put onto the website

When the due date is past due, the task card will turn red. When the due date is due later, the box will turn white to show you have time to turn in a task you assigned to the page.

I learned about how the modal forms work by having a premade modal html format and by adding labels to fill out the form as well as adding a dropdown calendar of what date the task is due. I also learned about making the cards draggable across the page to any boxes I want. I also learned about what color to give the cards when the tasks are not due on the day after or later that I assigned it via the calender, as well as if the task is overdue and gives a warning that the date is assigned before today's date.
